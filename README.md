## Future fetaures
1. Notifications and message notification are kind of interlinked ,means if you click on message section the red symbol on notifcation button will go away and vice versa, maybe do some changes so that clicking on message section doesn't affect notification section red symbol.
2. When you are chatting with someone, others person's messages won't be updated in real time you have to come out of chat box to see other person's message , maybe some changes can be done here to make real time update
3. Again, i am not a web designer , so design formats are not so good ,maybe a little more designing make it near perfect.
4. When someone comment on a post you can't reply to that reply ,you have to make a new comment, maybe allow user to make reply on a reply.
